The ticker symbol
Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

There is functionality to the script to return the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest total volume.

The appropriate adjustments were made to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
